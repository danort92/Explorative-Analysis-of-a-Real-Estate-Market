  Statistical study of a Real Estate dataset related to housing sales in Texas. The dataset contains the following variables: 
  
    - city: names of the cities involved in the analysis;
    - year: years involved in the analysis;
    - month: months involved in the analysis;
    - sales: total n° of sales;
    - volume: totale value of sales [M$];
    - median_price: sales median price [$];
    - listings: total n° of listings;
    - months_inventory: time amount necessary to sell all the active listings at the actual rythm [months]
    
  The project consists in the development of the following points:
  
  
  * _Desciption of the different variable types within the dataset;_
  
  * _Analysis of indices of position (mean, median, quantiles, etc.), variability (dispersion index, coefficient of dispersion, relative variance, standard deviation,         Gini index, etc.) and distribution form (Fisher asymmetry index, Kurtosis index);_
  
  * _Definition of an "Effectiveness" variable to look at which city/which year has been the most effective in terms of sales;_
  
  * _Use of moments, dplyr, ggplot, gghalves packages to show significative diagrams, boxplots, line charts and plots._
